Please refer to [trilinux.org/mbti-paper](https://bachstelze.gitlab.io/trilinux/MBTI_classification.pdf) for (preliminary!) paper and to https://huggingface.co/robookwus for inferencing our trained models.
I tried lots(!) of different training approaches, eventually getting very promising results. My plan is to take the best approach and train it with all the training data, as due to time restrictions and being so busy with finding the best model I was only able to train on a fraction of our scraped Reddit data. Also planning to publicize this huge dataset soon, it will be by far the best/biggest available dataset in the world wide web.

//will write a nice readme about it eventually!

MBTI Personality Classification

In this project, we built various supervised attention-based classifiers to predict an author's personality.
As a dataset for training we used Reddit comments.
